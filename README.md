# Print the path from a node to the root

## Due 04/17 at 11:59pm

Learning Goals
==============

* Construct binary trees from in-order and post-order expressions
* Find the path from a node (not necessarily a leaf node) to the root

Path to Root
============

Consider [a
binary](https://i1.wp.com/www.techiedelight.com/wp-content/uploads/Root-To-Leaf-Paths.png?resize=323%2C338&ssl=1). The
path from node 7 includes 7, 3, and 1. The path from 8 includes 8, 6,
3, and 1. Please notice that this is not necessarily a binary search
tree.

For simplicity, this assignment asks you to print the path from bottom to top (the root is printed last).


Submission
==========


You **must** follow the instructions precisely. Failing to follow
these instructions will likely make you receive zero in this
assignment.  Your score **is determined by your submission**, nothing
else.  The teaching staff is strictly prohibited seeing anything on
your computer for grading.

When you are ready to submit your code for grading, you need to *tag* the version you want us to grade. A tag is a way of assigning a name to a particular version of code. We look for the tag `final_ver` to decide what to grade.

1. Tag your local code: `> git tag final_ver`
2. Push the tag to GitHub: `> git push origin final_ver`

If you later decide you want to update the version you submit, you can tag a different version:

1. Update the tag: `> git tag final_ver -f`
2. Push the tag to GitHub: `git push origin final_ver -f`

We will grade whichever version has the `final_ver` tag at the due date.
